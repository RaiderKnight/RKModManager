<br>
<p>2- The right side is your local installation.<br>

<p>New mods are enabled by default. They will be added to the bottom of the local installation list.</p>
<br>

Double click it, to install the update or click "Update all installed modules" button.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Module priority</h3>
<p>There is no priority, but order in RKLauncher is bottom up, so everything that is at the end of the module list, has the higher priority. (This is used only for patches.)<br>
To move a module to a higher / lower priority just drag & drop it to the desired position in the local list.</p>
<br>

<p>Installed modules can be disabled at any moment by double-clicking them. They will get a [disabled] label.<br>
Double click again to enable them again.</p>

<p>You cannot disable lpaddons, the in game editors will always "see" presets supplied by these addons unless you delete the faulty addon.</p>
<br>
