# RKModManager
<p>A mod manager for LifePlay dedicated to the best mods and those that are compatible with the Remake.<br>
The other difference is that this mod manager only accepts well built, functional and unique mods.</p>
<p>This launcher/module manager is based on the LP-Modmanager plugin from NickNo.<br>

<br>
<h3>How to use the RKLauncher?</h3>
<p>Double click on RKLauncher.exe, a window will open.</p>
<br>
<p>This window is separated into two areas:</p>
<p>1- The left side is the list of all available mods/updates. <br>
This is where all downloadable modules and addons are listed.</p>
<br>
<p>2- The right side is your local installation.<br>
This is your LifePlay installation with all the mods that are currently installed.</p>
<br>
<p>To launch LifePlay click the green "Launch game" button in the bottom left corner.</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Installing mods and addons</h3>
<p>To install or update a module/addon from the repository just double click it. </p>
<p>RKLauncher will download the files and automatically install it into your local game folder.</p>
<p>New mods are enabled by default. They will be added to the bottom of the local installation list.</p>
<br>
<p>If there is an update available in the mods, a message will be displayed indicating the number of mods that need to be updated and they will get an "Updated" tag.<br>
Double click it, to install the update or click "Update all installed modules" button.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Module priority</h3>
<p>There is no priority, but order in RKLauncher is bottom up, so everything that is at the end of the module list, has the higher priority. (This is used only for patches.)<br>
To move a module to a higher / lower priority just drag & drop it to the desired position in the local list.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Disabling / Enabling modules</h3>
<p>Installed modules can be disabled at any moment by double-clicking them. They will get a [disabled] label.<br>
Double click again to enable them again.</p>
<br>
<p>You cannot disable lpaddons, the in game editors will always "see" presets supplied by these addons unless you delete the faulty addon.</p>
<br>
<p>To delete a mod: Just select the one you don't need then click the red "Delete selected module" button. The module will be erased permanently.</p>
