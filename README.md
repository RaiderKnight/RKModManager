# RKModManager
<p>A mod manager for LifePlay dedicated to the best mods and those that are compatible with the Remake.<br>
The other difference is that this mod manager only accepts well built, functional and unique mods.</p>
<p>This launcher/module manager is based on the LP-Modmanager plugin from NickNo.<br>
